    <p>I really loves games, Ive been playing games for 12 years 7 of those being on PC. If you play any games on a PC youre probably familiar with a company called Blizzard Entertainment.
       Blizzard was bought out by microsoft for $5.83 billion, Thats good for me because i have connections at Microsft and im looking forward to working there in the future   </p>
